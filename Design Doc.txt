Mini-game driven game. Each level has a series of timed mini games that the player must complete to gather data on whether or not the missile threat is real. Failing to complete a mini game will result in no data collected. Completing mini games will help you to gather data to cross reference with a rules given for the day and help to compile a report on your findings. Levels will increase in pacing and complexity, culminating in a final level where you'll forced to make a decision on whether or not to launch the nukes based on incomplete data.
